Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 1 session / week, 3 hours / session

Prerequisites
-------------

[_1.00 Introduction to Computers and Engineering Problem Solving_](/courses/1-00-introduction-to-computers-and-engineering-problem-solving-spring-2012/), [_6.005 Elements of Software Construction_](/courses/6-005-elements-of-software-construction-fall-2008), or permission of instructor.

Course Description
------------------

This class focuses on the programming, use, and HCI concerns of mobile media applications. Students work in small collaborative design teams to propose, build, and document a semester-long project focused on mobile applications for cell phones. Additional assignments include creating several small mobile applications such as context-aware applications and games. Students document their work through a series of written and oral proposals, progress reports, and final reports. This course covers the basics of Android programming and explores mobile imaging and media creation, GPS location, user-centered design, usability testing, and prototyping. Java experience is recommended.

Note: Although some material will be taught in Android 2.1, students are welcome to develop for other Android or iPhone OS-based devices if they have them. Android devices will be lent to project groups during the semester if they need one.

Project Description
-------------------

The semester-long project in this class consists of a path from ethnographic-style field work, to concept ideas, to a design, and finally to a resulting working system that creates a new experience for users on a mobile device.  Students should start by selecting a domain of interest (e.g. music playback/sharing, photo sharing, urban navigation, mobile health, fitness, education, etc.) and will conduct a rapid field study in this area to gain design inspiration.  In the analysis of this study, a concept for a final project should be chosen.  Good final projects have a larger scope and aim to create novel experiences in the world over simpler task-focused systems or mobile versions of web experiences.  Successful projects also take advantage of the unique aspects of mobile devices (context sensing, pervasive media capture, social connection, and near-always available internet).  Projects generally include a service component in addition to the mobile application.
